## XAutoLayout

uses some swift amazing feature, provides a very short and clear way to make constraints in code.  

### XCode 9 and swift 4

since swift 4 is reqiured, you need XCode 9 and above.


### Latest version

current latest version is **3.0**.

### Quick look

you must know what 'left.attr = right.attr * m + c' means for AutoLayout.

```swift

import XAutoLayout

// use `=/`` to make composite equal witch creates an array of NSLayoutConstraint
// TODO: add sample code

```


### What's *the matter* of AutoLayout ?

The API is not friendly for developers. Too long and too complicated. wish XAutoLayout will make our lives easier.
